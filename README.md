<h1>CSV Data Processor</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script serves as a data processing tool for reading and organizing information from a CSV file named 'input.csv.' The script starts by creating an empty 'database' to hold the data. It then opens the 'input.csv' file, skips the header, and processes each line. Each line is split into a list, and the relevant data is extracted and stored in a dictionary, including the person's name, address, and pricing rates. The script determines the appropriate pricing rate for each person based on their 'Box' category (A, B, or C) and displays their information, including the calculated cost. This code efficiently processes and prints the data from the CSV file, making it a useful tool for organizing and retrieving information.
